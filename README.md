# Weather App 
## Description: 
This app is developed using react + vite. The app is capable of fetching real time weather informations such as
temperature, humidity, pressure and visibility based on the location. Open weather api is used to fetch 
infos mentioned above. I've used react hook such as useState to handle the weather data in JSON format,
this hook also came handy while dealing with the location.

## Key features:
* Responsive design
* Realtime weather info

## Tech stack:
